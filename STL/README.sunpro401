Known problems

Version problems

If your CC 4.0.1 cannot compile testsuite, most likely you are using out-of
date version. You should download patch for 4.0.1 from SunPro site :

http://www.sun.com/smcc/solaris-migration/cmc.products.970709/XCM/101914-14.tar.Z
(SunOS 4.1.x)

Compiling

C++ 4.0.1 have problems recognizing types nested in template classes when
parsing declarations. For example , the following construct fails (suppose
STL vector is a base type for derived_vector ):

derived_vector<int> years;
derived_vector<int>::iterator i;

To work around this problem completely, you should repeat those typedefs
from base class that you are going to use in any way:

template <class T> class derived_vector : public vector<T> {
typedef vector<T>::iterator iterator;
...

More severe problems arise when given template argument's typedefs are used
as template arguments for base class. The example is function adaptors from
function.h . Refer to workarounds for binders & composers to see how it can
be hanled ( proposed by "Martin Abernethy" <gma@paston.co.uk> ).

C++ 4.01 may also suffer from optimization bugs when using exception
handling. If your application doesn't use exceptions, you'd better use -noex
option along with __STL_NO_EXCEPTIONS flag.

Linking

You may still have to use explicit instantiations and/or specific template
database controls for complex cases to avoid "unresolved symbol" linker
errors.

You may have troubles getting linker errors compiling multiple targets in
one directory ( for example, running cygnus testsuite). That is a bug in
handling Templates.DB dependencies. Known solutions are :

a) for one-file tests, specify option -pto (one-file-mode) option to turn
off database completely. Option -pts(single-file-mode) doesn't fix all
problems.

b) for complex projects, use separate Templates.DB directories for different
targets.

Migration notes

You should experience no other problems migrating from HP STL to SGI STL.

Versions prior to 4.1

SUNPro C++ older than 4.0.1 won't compile STL. You had to upgrade.
